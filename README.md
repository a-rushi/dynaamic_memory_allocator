# Dynamic_Memory_Allocator

This project is a course assignment for the course `COL106 - Data Structures and Algorithms` at IIT Delhi.

This project aims at building a dynamic memory allocation system to `allocate, free and defragment` memory blocks as queried by the user.

The allocator uses data structures like `Doubly Linked Lists`, `Binary Search Trees` and `AVL Trees` which are all constructed from scratch.

I have also provided the option to the users to choose either the `Best-Fit` or the `First-Fit` implementation as desired.

The entire system is implemented in `JAVA`.
